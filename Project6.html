				<ul>
				<li>Cvs has already made a move towards child labor. They were one of the first businesses to take out all of their tobacco containing products. While, doing this they took the risk to lose over 2 billion dollars a year.</li><br></br>
				<li>Laws have been passed for child labor but that does not mean we abide by them. For example farms are not allowed to hire children 17 and under without parent consent but they still do. Not only that but they encouage children that are little to lie about their age and say they older to get the job.</div>
