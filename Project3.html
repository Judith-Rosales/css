				<ul>
				<li>Child Labor has been around for centuries, although laws and rules have been passed that does not mean people abide by them.</li>
				<br></br>
				<li>Children used to be forced to work in the mines and factories back then. Now it is frowned upon for children to work because they would rather them have an eduction. Now in days children from 7 years old all the 17 years old work to support their family.</li>
				<br></br>
				<li>Child Labor causes them to lose not only their eduction but their child hood. They are forced to become an adult at such a young age.</li>
				<br></br>
				<li>In most farms or plantations children as young as seven years old work in tobacco fields with their parents consents and farmers have encouraged young children to lie about the age because they need the help and kids need the money.</li></div>
